# 📚 Interactive Learning Activity Generator

"Simply put, interactive learning is learning that requires student participation." - [Genially Blog](https://blog.genial.ly/en/interactive-learning/)


This project is a single-page web application that can be used to **generate code** for various _interactive learning activites_ which can be added into learning management systems. 

It is built using `HTML`, `CSS`, and simple  `JAVASCRIPT` without any plugins, libraries, or frameworks.

Users simply fill out a form, click generate, and are given code that can be copy/pasted into their learning management system.
